              </div>
              <p>I graduated high school in 2014 and I have been working full time since then, knowing that I intend to go to college but having no clue what for. I have contemplated nursing and other positions in the healthcare field but I never felt very passionate about healthcare. Over the past few months I have gained an interest in learning computer science and programming. I plan to begin pusrsuing a computer science degree beginning fall of 2017 and I am interested in learning as much as I can in the meantime. I felt that attending an inductroductory class on programming would be a step in the right direction, which is why I am attending Epicodus currently. So far I am enjoying learning and practicing as much as I can, and I am eager to watch my abilities develop over time.</p>
              <p class="about-me-p2">I currently work full-time as a caregiver which I enjoy very much, and I spend a lot of my time working overtime shifts. Some of my hobbies include:</p>
              <ul class="hobbies-list">
                <li>Bicycling</li>
                <li>Reading on personal development</li>
                <li>Traveling (when I can)</li>
                <li>Learning programming</li>

The webpage is intended to be for an animal shelter, displaying some of the animals that they have up for adoption. There are four different columns each displaying a different animal, and each column contains information about each animal as well as an image.</p>

              <p class="description">This is a webpage that I made to "advertise" a private island resort. The purpose of the project was for me to practice making a website containing multiple pages that would link to each other, as well as familiarizing myself with styling using CSS. The website starts at a homepage and you can then travel to five other pages to get more information about the resort. Each webpage also contains a link back to the homepage.</p>
